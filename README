ActiveResource classes for use with the Meetup.com API

I've used some of this code to power the Meetup API integration 
to generate meetup.com event name badges with http://big.first.name/


Example Usage:

First set your meetup.com api key in API_KEY in the base class MeetupResource

  rsvps = MeetupRsvp.for_event('9190765')
  first_rsvp = rsvps.first
  first_member_details = MeetupMember.for_member(first_rsvp.member_id)
  groups_of_first_member = MeetupGroup.for_member(first_member_details.id)
  fellow_group_member_details = MeetupMember.for_group(groups_of_first_member.map{|g| g.id}.join(","))
